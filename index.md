# The100DaysOfCode Challenge

In this blog I will be sharing my journey from Day1 to Day100 of my #The100DaysofCode Challenge..


## Day 1 - Pilot
On the first day of the challenge I decided to practise some of the basic programs such as Anagram check and array pair sum.
<br>
## Day 2 - Random Function
I Played with the Random Function in Python and created Password generation, Dice and Rock Paper Scissor Program.
<br>
## Day 3 - Sort
I Practised different searching algorithms - Insertion Sort, Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Quick Sort.
<br>
## Day 4 - Hangman Game
On day 4 I created the famous Hangman game, I used random function to give a different word everytime we play the game and also added difficulty levels.
<br>
## Day 5 - Searching
Day 5 was all about searching algorithms, I practiced some of the most common searching algorithms (Linear, Binary, Jump). Today was a busy day couldn't practice much.
<br>
## Day 6 - Classes
Followed the Intermediate Python Tutorial Playlist on YouTube by NeuralNine practiced Classes and Objects, Inheritance, Operator Overloading. 
<br>
## Day 7 - Multithreading
Learned Multithreading in python will be practicing this to get a better understanding of the concept.
<br>
## Day 8 - Events, Daemon Threads and Queues
With everyday passing I'm learning something new, need to start practicing more to get proper hold of the concepts.
<br>
## Day 9 -  Sockets and Recursion
Learned about the sockets for networking in python also practiced recursion using some common examples.
<br>
## Day 10 - Database Programming in Python
Today I tried the sqlite3 module in python. Tomorrow onwards I will either start learning Flask for the web applications or Tkinter to learn about the GUI.
<br>
## Day 11 - Created Flask App
Followed the tutorial by freeCodeCamp and created a Flask Task Manager App. The Application allows user to add, update and delete the task.
<br>
## Day 12 -  Logging and automated Python mailer
Today I created an automated mailer system in Python3 and learned about logging. I wonder what should I do tomorrow.
<br>
## Day 13 -  Python + New Year's Eve
Today, I created an ASCII art illustration using python and a countdown timer using turtle in python.
<br>
## Day 14 - Snake Game 
I created a snake game  using pygame module in python and followed the playlist created by TechWithTimm.
<br>
## Day 15 - TCP Chat Room
I created a TCP chat room which allows multiple clients to connect and communicate at the same time. And of course I used python for the same.
<br>
## Day 16 - Rewind Time - 1 
I revised all the concepts learned past 15 days and practiced them again. I have also decided to write a blog documenting all my days progress during the challenge.
<br>
## Day 17 - Wine Quality Prediction
I moved back to Data Science today, and created a Wine Quality Prediction model. I made it using different ML algorithms such as Decision Tree, GaussianNB, Random Forest, and K Nearest Neighbor.
<br>
## Day 18 - Decision Tree Classifier
I practiced the Decision Tree Classifier on a Drug Dataset, and build a model to find out which drug might be appropriate for a future patient with the similar illness.
<br>
## Day 19 - K Nearest Neighbor
I performed K Nearest Neighbor classification on a telecommunication provider data set. The example focuses on using demographic data, such as region, age, and marital, to predict usage patterns. The target field, called custcat, has four possible values that correspond to the four customer groups, as follows: 1- Basic Service 2- E-Service 3- Plus Service 4- Total Service.
<br>
## Day 20 - Logistic Regression
Using telecommunication dataset I performed Logistic Regression for predicting customer churn. I preprocessed, cleaned, Visualized and finally predicted the outcome.
<br>
## Day 21 - SVM (Support Vector Machines)
Practiced SVM to build and train a model using human cell records, and classify cells to whether the samples are benign or malignant.
<br>
## Day 22 - TensorFlow Basics
Back to Tensorflow module,and created 3 basic models.
- A simple value predictor based on the second variable.
- Apparel Predictor using Fashion_mnist dataset.
- Apparel Predictor (CNN) using Fashion_mnist dataset.

## Day 23 - Image Compressor
I created an Image Compressor Application using pillow and streamlit. The application is deployed on heroku. As of now it only accepts jpg images and reduces their dimension thereby compressing the image.

## Day 24 - Cat and Dog Classifier
I made a Cat and Dog Classifier and deployed it on streamlit. The model has 70% of validation accuracy. This was first time that I had actually deployed a model after creating it.
 
## Day 25 - Hand Written Digit Recognizer
Had a really lazy day today so just made a basic tensorflow handwritten digit recognizer based on the pre-made keras mnist datasets. Will also be reading a Research paper based on CNN today.
