<br>
## Day 16 - Rewind Time - 1 
I revised all the concepts learned past 15 days and practiced them again. I have also decided to write a blog documenting all my days progress during the challenge.
<br>
## Day 17 - Wine Quality Prediction
I moved back to Data Science today, and created a Wine Quality Prediction model. I made it using different ML algorithms such as Decision Tree, GaussianNB, Random Forest, and K Nearest Neighbor.
<br>
## Day 18 - Decision Tree Classifier
I practiced the Decision Tree Classifier on a Drug Dataset, and build a model to find out which drug might be appropriate for a future patient with the similar illness.
<br>
## Day 19 - K Nearest Neighbor
I performed K Nearest Neighbor classification on a telecommunication provider data set. The example focuses on using demographic data, such as region, age, and marital, to predict usage patterns. The target field, called custcat, has four possible values that correspond to the four customer groups, as follows: 1- Basic Service 2- E-Service 3- Plus Service 4- Total Service.
<br>
## Day 20 - Logistic Regression
Using telecommunication dataset I performed Logistic Regression for predicting customer churn. I preprocessed, cleaned, Visualized and finally predicted the outcome.
<br>
## Day 21 - SVM (Support Vector Machines)
Practiced SVM to build and train a model using human cell records, and classify cells to whether the samples are benign or malignant.
<br>
## Day 22 - TensorFlow Basics
Back to Tensorflow module,and created 3 basic models.
- A simple value predictor based on the second variable.
- Apparel Predictor using Fashion_mnist dataset.
- Apparel Predictor (CNN) using Fashion_mnist dataset.

## Day 23 - Image Compressor
I created an Image Compressor Application using pillow and streamlit. The application is deployed on heroku. As of now it only accepts jpg images and reduces their dimension thereby compressing the image.

## Day 24 - Cat and Dog Classifier
I made a Cat and Dog Classifier and deployed it on streamlit. The model has 70% of validation accuracy. This was first time that I had actually deployed a model after creating it.
 
## Day 25 - Hand Written Digit Recognizer
Had a really lazy day today so just made a basic tensorflow handwritten digit recognizer based on the pre-made keras mnist datasets. Will also be reading a Research paper based on CNN today.

## Day 26 - Tomato Leaf Disease Detection
As a part of learning process I made a tomato disease detector which using CNN succesfully differentiate between a tomato with a infected leaf and a healthy leaf and deployed it using streamlit.

## Day 27 - Covid19 Analysis
I performed analysis on different Covid 19 Datasets such as confirmed cases, deaths and recoveries in different countries.

## Day 28 - Sentiment Analysis (Sarcasm)
Followed the NLP tutorial on Tensorflow and created a Sentiment Analyser which can predict the level of sarcasm in any text.But I have realised I'm more awed by CNN so will be learning more about Image Processing for next few days or even weeks.

## Day 29 - Plant Disease Detection
I continued to work on the plant disease detection model to build a model in a way that it can predict the difference between a bacterial spot infected pepper plant, healthy pepper plant, healthy tomato plant and an early blight infected plant. Still working on to improve the accuracy.

## Day 30 - Plant Disease Detection (Updated for better accuracy)
Added dropout and an addition CNN layer in the ANN to avoid the problem of overfitting while training. Got better accuracy than the previous model but still haven't perfected it.

## Day 31 - Exploratory Data Analysis (Retail)
I performed an in depth exploratory data analysis on a sample superstore dataset and looked at the various factors / areas that can help to make up more profit.

## Day 32 - Indian Vehicular Data Analysis
I performed a simple data analysis using a dataset from kaggle and predict the selling price of the vehicle based on different factors.

## Day 33 - Exploratory Data Analysis - Terrorism
As a part of my day 33 of #100DaysOfCode challenge, I performed data analysis on global terrorism dataset.

## Day 34 - Rewind 2
I visited some older codes which I had done before to practice them I have also decided to practice Cracking the Coding Interview book on a daily basis.

## Day 35 - Rock Paper Scissor Hand Gesture Recognizer
Today I created a Rock Paper Scissor Hand Gesture Recognizer model using CNN in tensorflow and deployed the same on streamlit.

## Day 36 - Caesar Encryption
Made a Caesar encryption program which shifts every character in the string to a given value thereby hiding the original message.

## Day 37 - AI Chatbot
Today I created an AI chatbot (with limited vocabulary) using NLTK and TensorFlow modules in python. The bot answers some fundamental questions. NLP seems to be hard and immensely fascinating at the same time.

## Day 38 - Web Scrapping I
Today I started to learn web scrapping and performed some basic operations on an HTML document using bs4 module in python. I'm following the video by freeCodeCamp.org to do so.

## Day 39 - Web Scrapping II
Performed web scrapping on a job hunting website using Beautiful Soap and request libraries in python. Also had a minor surgery today.

## Day 40 - Web Scrapping III
I finished a basic web scrapping exercise by scrapping out jobs based on my preferences from a job hunting site and saved them in text files.

## Day 41 - KNN II
Back to Machine Learning, Performed KNN on a dataset a plotted to graph to predict accuracy at different values of K.

## Day 42 - SVM II
Performed SVM and KNN on a common dataset and compared their scores on different K and soft margin values.

## Day 43 - Decision Tree and Random Forest
Performed Decision Tree and Random Forest classification on a Drug dataset and tested the accuracy for both.

## Day 44 - KMeans Clustering
Using a customer segmentation dataset, I performed KMeans Clustering to classify the customers based on their age, income and education.

## Day 45 - Logistic Regression II
Practiced Logistic Regression today on a telecommunication database for predicting customer churn.

## Day 46 - Stock Prediction Attempt 1 and Tkinter Calculator
I created a tkinter calculator which can do basic mathematical operations also tried to make a stock price predictor using LSTM will continue to work on that tomorrow.

## Day 47 - Streamlit ML App
I built and deployed an ML application on streamlit which allows user to select between KNN, SVM, Decision Tree, and Random Forest to predict the outcome of some predefined datasets and then plotting the graph for the same.
